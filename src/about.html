                Fluid is an <strong>open, collaborative project</strong> to improve the user experience and
                inclusiveness of open source software.
            </p>

            <p>
                The Fluid community consists of an international team of partners, individuals, and institutions focused
                on designing inclusive, ï¬‚exible, customizable, user-centered interfaces.

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Design of inclusive user interfaces:</strong> combining both design and technology to create
                    a living library of sharable user interface components</li>
                <li><strong>Build web tools:</strong> providing an easy way to build JavaScript-based user interfaces
                    that are highly flexible and reusable. Built using Web standards and the jQuery toolkit, Infusion
                    provides a lightweight application development framework supporting simple Model View Controller
                    (MVC) techniques</li>
                <li><strong>Create design resources:</strong> curating a <a
                        href="http://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Design+Handbook">Design Handbook<span
                            class="fluid-web-external-link" role="presentation"></span></a> (for designers and
                    developers alike) including tools and techniques that are easy to use, learn, and modify</li>
                <li><strong>Teach inclusive design:</strong> giving demonstrations and teaching others at conferences
                    and meetings</li>
                <li><strong>Nurture an open and inclusive culture:</strong> documenting and making publicly available
                    community processes to support an agile approach to design and development in an open source project
                </li>
            </ul>
