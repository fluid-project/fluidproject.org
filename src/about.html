        <h2 class="fluid-web-emphasized-text">Areas of Focus</h2>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Design of inclusive user interfaces:</strong> combining both design and technology to create a living library of sharable user interface components</li>
            <li><strong>Build web tools:</strong> providing an easy way to build JavaScript-based user interfaces that are highly flexible and reusable. Built using Web standards and the jQuery toolkit, Infusion provides a lightweight application development framework supporting simple Model View Controller (MVC) techniques</li>
            <li><strong>Create design resources:</strong> curating a <a href="http://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Design+Handbook">Design Handbook<span class="fluid-web-external-link" role="presentation"></span></a> (for designers and developers alike) including tools and techniques that are easy to use, learn, and modify</li>
            <li><strong>Teach inclusive design:</strong> giving demonstrations and teaching others at conferences and meetings</li>
            <li><strong>Nurture an open and inclusive culture:</strong> documenting and making publicly available community processes to support an agile approach to design and development in an open source project</li>
        </ul>
