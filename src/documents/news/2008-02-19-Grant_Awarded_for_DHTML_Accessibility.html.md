The Adaptive Technology Resource Centre at the University of Toronto has received a grant from the Mozilla Foundation to promote DHTML accessibility and the adoption of ARIA (the W3C Web Accessibility Initiative's Accessible Rich Internet Applications specification).

The Fluid project will participate in this work, which will involve evangelism, mentoring, community-building, and technical leadership. One of the key contributions will be to work with the jQuery community to implement ARIA support in this popular toolkit.
