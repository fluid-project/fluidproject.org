The Fluid Project is pleased to announce the first release of the Fluid component library and
User Experience (UX) Toolkit.

### What&#39;s New in This Release

- The Reorderer, a JavaScript library for sorting DOM elements
- The Lightbox, a component for organizing image thumbnails
- Drag and drop UI design patterns
- Checklists and protocols for doing UX walkthroughs
- Sample code, tutorials, and lots of documentation

### What is Fluid

The Fluid component library is a small but growing collection of rich,  reusable, accessible user interface
components that can be used across  web applications. These components have been designed by a  cross-disciplinary
team and thoroughly tested for usability and  accessibility. By incorporating Fluid components into your web
application&#39;s user interface, you can make your application easier to  use by more people. Easier to
use means happier users.

### Fluid is Open Source

Fluid&#39;s source code is dual licensed under the ECL 2.0 and BSD licenses.  Our UX Toolkit is available
under a Creative Commons license.

### Known Issues

Fluid is still in early development, and this release has a number of  known issues. API changes will be coming
in the future, so for now, we  encourage you to use 0.1 for experimentation and prototyping. Check the
README.txt file in the download package for a list of known issues.

Thanks to everyone in the community for their hard work on this release!
