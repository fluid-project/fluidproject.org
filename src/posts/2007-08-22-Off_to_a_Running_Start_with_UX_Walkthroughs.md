The Fluid team is using UX (user experience) walkthroughs of target applications to identify
&quot;pain points&quot; encountered by users.

As the primary goal of Fluid is to improve the user&rsquo;s experience, we plan to apply recognized
and formally constituted methods to identify problems and prioritize improvements. With this in mind,
at the very beginning of the project, we started defining and documenting a step-by-step UX walkthrough
process &ndash; a combination of usability and accessibility
heuristic evaluations with cognitive walkthroughs &ndash; and are now putting this into practice with
Sakai and uPortal as our first subjects.

We welcome volunteers! If you are interested in helping, you can:

- Join the Sakai, Moodle, or uPortal
  [working groups](http://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/UX+Walkthrough+Working+Groups) and
  help out with the walkthroughs themselves.

- Improve the
  [UX Walkthrough area](http://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/User+Experience+Walkthroughs) of
  our wiki as it is in need of organization and consolidation. If you&rsquo;ve got time for some
  quick editing and re-organization, please feel free! </br>

- Share your accessibility expertise and advice with the
  [working groups](http://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/UX+Walkthrough+Working+Groups).

For more information on UX Walkthroughs, please see the
[UX Walkthrough area](http://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/User+Experience+Walkthroughs) on our wiki.
