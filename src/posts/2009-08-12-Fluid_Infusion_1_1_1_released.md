Fluid Infusion 1.1.1 released {.fluid-web-emphasized-text}

Posted by Jacob Farber on 2009-08-12

Infusion 1.1.1 is here! This release is a maintenance release, which
means no new features were added but several bugs were fixed for our
Inline Edit and Reorderer components. Infusion 1.1.1 is an incremental
upgrade and preserves backwards compatibility for all production-grade
components.

### In this release

This release was mostly bug fixing, addressing important issues in the
Inline Edit and Reorderer components.

addressed:

1. [Text inside inline editor is being lost after canceling the text
    edit.](http://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-3077)
2. [Typing "Click here to edit" is equivalent to erasing all the
    text](/browse/FLUID-1320)
3. [Item will drop to the right of an element when it should have
    dropped at the left.](/browse/FLUID-2967)
4. [tiny _mce Inline Edit text editor fails when used with advanced

### What is Fluid Infusion

Fluid Infusion is an application framework for building usable and
accessible user interfaces with JavaScript. Built on top of jQuery,
Infusion takes a different approach to client-side development. At
heart, Infusion is an open architecture designed to put you back in
control of your application’s user experience. It includes a growing
collection of UI components—reusable interactions that go deeper than
most widgets. Created by a community of developers and interaction
designers, Infusion components are built from the ground up with
accessibility in mind. All of our designs can be used with assistive
technologies, are fully controllable with the keyboard, and can be
transformed to suit your users’ personal needs.

Fluid Infusion includes a collection of our UI components, tutorials to
help you get started, solid APIs to help you dive in, and the community
to lend a hand.
