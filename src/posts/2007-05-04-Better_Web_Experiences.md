The **Fluid Project** ([https://fluidproject.org](https://fluidproject.org/)),
a worldwide collaborative project that will help to improve the usability and accessibility of community
source software projects, was recently chosen by the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation for $2.5 million in
support. The project is led by the Adaptive Technology Resource Centre at the University of Toronto
along with the University of California at Berkeley, University of British Columbia, York University,
and Cambridge University. Other partners include Michigan State University, University of Colorado,
University of Michigan, Sun Microsystems, the Mozilla Foundation, and IBM.

Fluid will develop and freely distribute a library of sharable user interfaces designed to improve the
user experience of web applications. These interface components will be built specifically to support
flexibility and customization while maintaining a high standard of usability, accessibility, and
internationalization. The Fluid software will enable designers and developers to build user interfaces
that can more readily accommodate diverse personal and institutional needs.

&quot;The end result will be a library of high quality, accessible, usable user-interface components that
universities internationally and any number of large organizations around the world can use, and ultimately
a better web experience for users,&quot; says Jutta Treviranus, the director of the Adaptive Technology
Resource Centre and principal investigator on the Fluid Project. Fluid&#39;s rich user interface components
will be included in several academic community source products including Sakai and uPortal.

The project will also foster the contributions of skilled interaction designers, testers, and accessibility
experts within open source communities. Fluid will create a user-centered design toolkit that will provide
useful documentation and research about web usability and accessibility. This toolkit will be freely shared
with the Moodle, Sakai, uPortal, and Kuali Student communities.

Although Fluid will initially focus on improving academic software, the technology may also be useful in
other web software products. Rich Schwerdtfeger, chair of the IBM Accessibility Architecture Review Board
says, &quot;Fluid will be the first project to deliver a personalized Web 2.0 experience for people with
disabilities. Although the Fluid Project is targeted for the learning space, what we learn should have
broader web implications in the future.&quot;

Many of the Fluid Project partners are founding contributors to the academic community source software
movement, and bring a wealth of design and development expertise to the project. Please visit

### About the Participating Software Projects

**Sakai** is a free and open source online collaboration and learning environment. Many users
of Sakai deploy it to support teaching and learning, ad hoc group collaboration, support for portfolios and
research collaboration. [http://www.sakaiproject.org](http://www.sakaiproject.org/)

**uPortal** is an open source, enterprise portal collaboratively developed by higher-education
institutions and commercial affiliates. uPortal is led by JA-SIG, the global consortium promoting open
technology for higher education. [http://www.uportal.org](http://www.uportal.org/)

**Moodle** is a course management system--a free, open source software package designed using
sound pedagogical principles, to help educators create effective online learning communities.
[http://www.moodle.org](http://www.moodle.org/)

The **Kuali Student Service System** will deliver a new generation student system that will be
developed through the Community Source process, delivered through service-oriented methodologies and technologies,
and sustained by an international community of institutions and firms.

### About the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation

The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation is a private philanthropic institution, with assets of approximately
$5.5 billion, that makes grants on a    selective basis to institutions of higher education, independent
